# csv_to_md

## About:
A simple Python script for converting a CSV file into Markdown format. I originally developed this script as a side project well working at the HCR Lab because I needed something to convert csv files to markdown format. This tool was essential in adding csv file to markdown files for a repository.

## How To Use:
0. All you need for this project to work is Python3 and the main.py script.
1. Find a CSV file you want to convert. Lets call this file example.csv
2. Run the main.py script like this:
    ```
    python3 main.py example.csv
    ```
3. After the script is done running, you will have a file that is the same name is your CSV file but instead of the .csv extension it has a .md extension. With our case, the file will be called example.md
4. Open the outputed .md file; copy and paste its content into any markdown file you want.
